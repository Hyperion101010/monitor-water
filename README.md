# monitor-water
Ministry of Water Resource(India) needed a tool to monitor and assess groundwater usage of Industries in India. My team developed a real-time monitoring system that includes 2D/3D/map visualisation of water usage data, AI model to predict future water usage, ability to notify expired/malpractices carried by Industries and the ability to configure the tool according to administrators needs. Officers can now use this tool to monitor the water usage in real time in a centralized hassle-free manner of Industries throughout India.
